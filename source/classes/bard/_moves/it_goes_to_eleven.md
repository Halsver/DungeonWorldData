# It Goes To Eleven
When you unleash a crazed performance (a righteous lute solo or mighy brass blast, maybe) choose a target who can hear you and roll+CHA. 

 * On a 10+ the target attacks their nearest ally in range. 
 * On a 7-9 they attack their nearest ally, but you also draw their attention and ire.
