When the gods themselves notice your misdeeds, though, that’s where your luck runs out and a mohrg is born. The mohrg is a skeleton—flesh and skin and hair all rotted away. All but their guts—their twisted, knotted guts still spill from their bellies, magically preserved and often wrapped, noose-like, about their necks. They do not think, exactly, but they suffer. They kill and wreak havoc and their souls do not rest. Such is the punishment, both on them for the crime and on all mankind for daring to murder one another. The gods are just and they are harsh.","instinct":"To wreak havoc","armor":0,"hp":10,"attacks":[{"name":"Bite","damage":"d8","tags":["close"]}],"name":"Mohrg","tags":["group"],"moves":["Rage","Add to their collection of guts"],"key":"mohrg"},"mummy":{"description":"There are cultures who revere the dead.
